/* There are 3 types of programming in C++ language : */

// 1. Procedural Oriented Programming
// 2. Functional Programming
// 3. Object Oriented Programming

// To deal with the problems of procedural and functional programming we have object oriented programming.

/* WHY OOPS ?? */

// The provide more safety to our data and keep functions and properties of the objects at same place for better understanding and security purposes.
// Code becomes Modular/ Structured through which it is only accessible in its block and not publicly.



// WHY C++ IS CALLED PARTIALLY OBJECT ORIENTED LANGUAGE ??

// The code works fine even if it is in the main functionn and there is no need to declare the class for it.
// Moreover the function is outside the class.
